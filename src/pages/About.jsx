                Hi, I'm Hieu Tran, a passionate web developer based in Orlando, FL. My journey into coding started with a love for gaming and technology, which evolved into a deep curiosity about how software works behind the scenes. What fascinates me most is how a few lines of code can create interactive experiences that people around the world can engage with.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm currently honing my skills at the University of Florida Coding Bootcamp, focusing on Full Stack Development. From front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and React to back-end frameworks like Node.js and MongoDB, I'm dedicated to mastering the tools that bring digital experiences to life.
              </p>
              <p>
                My goal is to build innovative, user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems. I'm eager to explore emerging web technologies, contribute to open-source projects, and continuously push the boundaries of what I can create.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I'm not coding, you'll find me gaming or attending tech meetups. I'm always open to collaborating with fellow developers and tech enthusiastsâ€”so feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or check out my projects on GitHub!
